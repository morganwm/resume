MORGAN WATSON-MORRIS

Overview
     •     5 Years at Apple: Infrastructure/Services on Manufacturing data (Current Job)
     •     2 Years at Startups: Application/Services
     •     2 Years at Dow Chemical: Robotics/Automation
   I have a wide variety of experience with different technologies and aspects of the stack, from lower-level services in Go, API backends in Python, Node, and Java, to
CI/CD with both binaries and Docker Images, Kubernetes management both directly and with Helm, AWS infrastructure and orchestration. I also enjoy working with
customers and alongside partner teams to get a better understanding of a problem and hopefully come up with a solution that addresses what matters instead of a
symptom of the root problem.

            In my current role within Apple, I have worked on several different applications and services which all share the same goal, taking the enormous amount of
information generated by our factories and allowing people to do something useful. This has taken many forms, a distributed real-time platform written in Go to help
feed fraud detection ML models, backends for advanced analytical platforms in Python to help researchers draw business value, and most recently a new method for
extracting, collecting, and organizing unstructured data to feed the growing wildfire that is AI/ML training.
